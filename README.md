# patrick's monorepo

"*premature optimization is the root of all evil*" - Donald Knuth

with that being said this is my fully dockerised monorepo complete with a CI/CD pipeline that deploys onto my single home server serving multiple websites and a database :).

### purpose

for now this monorepo holds the code for my websites under [patrickdd.com](patrickdd.com) and [patrickdumdum.com](patrickdumdum.com) and i plan to build other projects on this monorepo. 

TODO: more docs
